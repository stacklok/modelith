# Working on modelith

Context for agents (and humans) working **on** modelith itself. For *using* the
tool, start with the [README](./README.md) and [`docs/`](./docs/).

modelith is a single static Go binary (cobra CLI: `lint`, `render`, `schema`)
that validates and renders `*.modelith.yaml` domain models. Module path
`github.com/stacklok/modelith`.

### Why this layout

- **`internal/schema/` is the source of truth for the format.** The Go code
  embeds each version's JSON Schema via `go:embed`; the canonical copy is
  destined for a stable URL (`https://modelith.sh/schema/domain-model/v1.json`)
  that editors will fetch via the `# yaml-language-server: $schema=` header once
  it's served (a roadmap item — not live yet; the CLI/CI embed the schema, so
  they don't depend on it). Living under `internal/` keeps the *Go API* private
  (`internal/` is a Go-compiler rule) without affecting URL reachability.
  Versions are directories (`v1/`,
  `v2/`, …) so the repo layout mirrors the URL layout and adding one is additive.
- **`internal/` not `pkg/`** — this is a tool, not a library. The CLI and the
  published schema are the contract; the Go API is private. Promote to a public
  API later only if there's demand.
- **`docs/` is self-contained Docusaurus content** built and served by the
  `website/` directory at [modelith.sh](https://modelith.sh).
- **`plugin/` ships the agent tooling next to the binary it drives**, so skills
  and the CLI version stay in lockstep.

## Dev workflow

The repo uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev). The one that matters:

```sh
task check   # run before pushing — CI parity plus local plugin validation
```

`task check` runs `vet`, `staticcheck`, `test`, `lint-models`, `render-check`,
and (locally only) `validate-plugin`. Run `task` with no arguments to list every
target. The full target table, build/install steps, and how to develop the
Claude Code plugin with `--plugin-dir` live in
[`docs/09-local-development.md`](./docs/09-local-development.md).

## Conventions to keep (these break CI if ignored)

- **The example is a golden fixture.** `examples/example.modelith.yaml` and its
  committed `examples/example.modelith.md` must stay in sync. After any change to
  the renderer *or* the example, run `task render` (or `modelith render
  examples/example.modelith.yaml`) to regenerate the `.md`. `task render-check` /
  CI fails on drift; `internal/render/markdown` has a golden test against it. The
  example must also lint clean under `task lint-models` (strict: completeness
  gaps are errors).
- **Schema ↔ structs stay in sync.** `internal/schema/v1/modelith.schema.json`
  and `internal/model/model.go` are guarded by `TestSchemaStructSync` (every
  schema property has a matching struct json field and vice versa). Every object
  is `additionalProperties: false`.
- **The canonical schema URL appears in three places** — the schema's `$id`, the
  Go `URLFor`/`URL` in `internal/schema/schema.go`, and the example header — and
  `TestURLConsistency` fails if they drift. Don't hardcode the URL elsewhere.
- **The binary, not the schema, owns supported versions.** `internal/schema`
  holds a `registry` (version → embedded bytes); `lint` reads the declared
  `version` and gives a friendly error before schema validation. Adding a format
  version = new `vN/` schema + a registry entry; never mutate a shipped version.
- **The `docs/` follow publishing conventions.** They are built by `website/`
  and served at [modelith.sh](https://modelith.sh). Page files are numbered
  `NN-name.md` (landing is plain `index.md`), carry `title:`, and cross-link with
  relative, prefix-included paths. The `docs/05-parking-garage/` example is
  lint/render-checked by CI, globbed **by path** in `Taskfile.yml` and
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — renumber that dir and you must update both. Full
  rules: [`docs/_docs-conventions.md`](./docs/_docs-conventions.md).

## Format decisions (already made — don't relitigate without reason)

- **Format evolution requires the new structured forms; no legacy string forms.**
  Invariants are `{id, statement}` referenced by `id`; enums are first-class
  (top-level `enums`, referenced from an attribute `type`); a top-level
  `glossary` defines non-entity vocabulary; actions are a bare string *or*
  `{name, actor?, preserves?, description?}`; attributes can be `derived` (with a
  required `derivation`). See [`docs/06-schema-reference.md`](./docs/06-schema-reference.md).
- **Stay on schema `v1`** while pre-release — there's no external `*.modelith.yaml`
  corpus to preserve, so the format evolves in place rather than bumping to v2.

## Cutting a release

Push a `vX.Y.Z` tag on `main` — `release.yml` builds, signs, generates SBOMs,
publishes the GitHub Release, and pushes the Homebrew formula to
`stacklok/homebrew-tap`. After it succeeds:

- **Bump `action.yml`'s `version` input default to the new tag and commit.**
  `action.yml` downloads a specific pinned release rather than building from
  source (see [`docs/08-github-action.md`](./docs/08-github-action.md)) — skip
  this step and the action keeps installing an old release indefinitely, with
  no error to flag it.
- **Bump `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `version` to match, if the
  plugin/skills changed.** The plugin ships next to the binary it drives so
  the two stay in lockstep (see "Repository layout" above) — this doesn't
  enforce itself.
- **If the plugin is listed on the Claude plugin marketplace**
  (`anthropics/claude-plugins-community`), check whether a meaningful
  `plugin/` change needs to be re-submitted there too. Marketplace entries
  pin a specific commit SHA (confirmed by inspecting that repo's
  `marketplace.json`) — listing it once does not mean it tracks `main`
  afterward. The exact re-submission mechanism wasn't determined as of this
  writing (submission is via <https://clau.de/plugin-directory-submission>,
  not a PR — direct PRs against that repo are auto-closed).

## Design history

Durable project records live under [`project-docs/`](./project-docs/), kept off
the published site to keep the root clean:

- [`project-docs/adr/`](./project-docs/adr/) — **forward-looking** decision
  records. When you make a hard-to-reverse call with real trade-offs, record it
  as an ADR so intentions stay current. Shape and bar:
  [`.claude/rules/adr.md`](./.claude/rules/adr.md).
- [`project-docs/audits/`](./project-docs/audits/) — **retrospective**
  multi-agent audit snapshots (rationale for the choices above) and the process
  for running new ones.

The only known open follow-up is a release-branch guard for `release.yml`,
tracked as [issue #1](https://github.com/stacklok/modelith/issues/1).

## Working conventions

- **Every commit must be signed off (DCO).** Commit with `git commit -s` so a
  `Signed-off-by:` trailer is added, certifying you have the right to submit
  the change under the project's license. `.github/workflows/dco.yml` enforces
  this on every commit in a PR and fails the check if any commit lacks the
  trailer. Details: [`dco.md`](./dco.md).
- **Coding and process rules are path-triggered.**
  [`.claude/rules/`](./.claude/rules/) holds `go-style.md`, `testing.md`,
  `adr.md`, and `agent-workflow.md`; each declares the paths it governs and
  loads when you edit a matching file. Where a rule file and this file disagree
  on a point it covers, the rule file wins.
- **Non-trivial or risky code changes** follow the subagent review-loop and
  model-discipline protocol in
  [`.claude/rules/agent-workflow.md`](./.claude/rules/agent-workflow.md). It is
  available discipline for changes that put a correctness-critical surface at
  risk, not a mandate on every commit.
- **Scratch work** (spikes, smoke tests, throwaway fixtures, review
  round-records) goes in the repo-local, gitignored
  [`.scratch/`](./.scratch/) — not `/tmp` or a session temp dir. It stays
  browsable in the checkout; clean it manually when stale.
- **`HANDOFF.md`** (repo root, gitignored, local-only) holds running state:
  current state, decisions in flight, ordered next steps. Update it before
  ending a significant session. Never commit it or reference it from tracked
  files.
