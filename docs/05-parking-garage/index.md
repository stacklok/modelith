description: A real authoring session, lightly edited — building a parking-garage domain model from scratch by talking to the agent across three passes.

# Worked Example: Parking Garage

Now that you've seen the parts — [authoring with the
agent](../02-getting-started.md), the [model's
structure](../03-understanding-your-model.md), and [reading the
diagrams](../04-reading-the-diagrams.md) — this is **bringing it all together** on a
meaty example.

It's a real session with the [`domain-model-author`](../02-getting-started.md)
skill, lightly edited for length. It builds a parking-garage model **from
nothing** — no YAML written by hand — and shows the loop you'll actually run: the
agent asks the questions, you make the calls, it drafts and lints the YAML and
keeps the rendered Markdown in sync.

The point isn't the typing. It's the **questions** — where the agent makes you
decide what a concept *is*, and where it refuses to encode something until an
ambiguity is resolved.

The finished artifacts:

- **[The rendered model](./garage.modelith.md)** — the diagram + tables a reader
  sees (this is what gets committed and circulated).
- **[The source `garage.modelith.yaml`](https://github.com/stacklok/modelith/blob/main/docs/05-parking-garage/garage.modelith.yaml)**
  — the canonical YAML the conversation produced.

## Getting started

> **You:** I want to build a system to track a parking garage. I think the top
> level is `Garage` or `Location`, and off of that an array of `Spot`s. Some
> spots are reserved and some aren't. There's a `Car` with some metadata. Cars
> enter two ways — a keycard for monthly parking, or a temporary ticket paid at a
> kiosk on exit.
>
> **Agent:** Clean domain. Before I build anything, one thing you described
> points at a concept you *didn't* name — the **stay itself**: the period a car
> occupies the garage from entry to exit. That's almost certainly the central
> entity, and the keycard path and the ticket path are just two ways of *starting
> one*. I'll propose calling it `Visit`.
>
> A few decisions that shape everything else:
>
> 1. **Hierarchy** — flat `Garage → Spot`, or do you need `Level`/`Zone` in
>    between?
> 2. **Reserved spots** — is "reserved" a `Spot` assigned to a monthly account,
>    or a full booking system?
> 3. **The temporary visitor's car** — modeled as a `Car`, or just a plate
>    captured on the `Ticket`?
> 4. **Who owns what** — does an `Account` own its `Keycard`s and `Car`s?

The agent surfaced `Visit` before writing a line — the missing noun was the most
important decision in the model.

> **You:** Flat `Garage → Spot`, no `Level`. `Visit` is good. Reserved = a spot
> assigned to a monthly account. Temporary visitors are just a plate on the
> ticket — no `Car`. And yes, an `Account` owns its keycards and cars.

## Pass 1 — the skeleton

The agent names every entity, writes a crisp definition for each, and declares
the relationships and cardinality. **Nothing else** — no attributes, rules, or
scenarios yet. This is the highest-leverage step, and it already renders a real
ER diagram.

> **Agent:** Skeleton's in — 8 entities, lints with 0 errors. Here's the diagram:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Account {}
    Car {}
    Garage {}
    Keycard {}
    Kiosk {}
    Spot {}
    Ticket {}
    Visit {}
    Account ||--o{ Keycard : ""
    Account ||--o{ Car : ""
    Garage ||--o{ Spot : ""
    Garage ||--o{ Kiosk : ""
    Spot ||..|| Account : ""
    Ticket }o..|| Kiosk : ""
    Visit }o..|| Spot : ""
    Visit }o..|| Car : ""
    Visit }o..|| Keycard : ""
    Visit ||--|| Ticket : ""
```

> **Agent:** This is the minimum useful model — honest to stop here and
> circulate. Three things to sanity-check before I add behavior:
>
> 1. **`Spot → Account` is 1:1** — one reserved spot per parker. If a parker can
>    hold several, that's `n:1`.
> 2. **"exactly one of `Keycard` or `Ticket`" can't be drawn** — the diagram
>    shows both as possible. That becomes an **invariant** in Pass 2.
> 3. **No `Payment` entity** — I'm treating the kiosk payment as future
>    attributes on `Ticket`.

> **You:** Let's go `n:1` for spot→account. Any of the cars on an account can
> park in any of its spots.

A one-line change to the cardinality; the diagram updates to `Spot }o..|| Account`.

## Pass 2 — the behavior

With the skeleton settled, the agent adds **invariants** (rules that must always
hold) and **scenarios** (short narratives that exercise every entity).

> **Agent:** Pass 2 done — 9 invariants, every entity governed; 5 scenarios
> touching all 8 entities. One rule worth your eye: `account-keycard-required`
> ("an `Account` has at least one `Keycard`") is the most opinionated one. If
> accounts can exist before a card is issued, I should soften it.

This is where a vague idea turned into a sharper model:

> **You:** If we have multiple spots per account, they'll need multiple keycards
> too. An `Account` is really more of a **billing entity**. Be clear that an
> account holder with a keycard *can* have a reserved spot, or can just use
> general spots — you pay extra for a reserved one.
>
> **Agent:** Good — `Account` becomes the billing entity, and a reserved `Spot`
> is an optional paid upsell, not the defining feature. An account holder always
> gets gate access (≥1 `Keycard`) and parks in general spots like anyone else;
> paying extra buys reserved spots, but an account can have **zero**. No
> cardinality changes — this is a definition sharpening. I'll add a scenario for
> the "monthly parker with no reserved spot" path so it's exercised, not just
> asserted.

### Where the agent caught a contradiction

> **You:** That sounds like a good invariant — you shouldn't have more keycards
> than spots. Also, a keycard is tied to a `Visit`; you can't use the same
> keycard to start two visits at once. So there's state on a keycard for which
> visit it's in, if any.
>
> **Agent:** Two things, and one has a conflict I want to flag before encoding
> it.
>
> **Anti-passback** — "a keycard ties to one active `Visit`; can't start a second
> while in use" — is unambiguous. Adding it as an invariant and a scenario now.
>
> **The count rule conflicts with what we just built.** You said *"more keycards
> than spots"* — literally that's `keycards ≤ reserved spots`. But last turn we
> established an account can have a keycard and **zero** reserved spots (the
> general-spot parker). Under that rule, a 1-card / 0-spot account would be
> illegal. I think you mean the **inverse**: `reserved spots ≤ keycards` — you
> can't reserve more spots than you have cards to use them, and zero reserved is
> fine. I don't want to encode it backwards — which did you mean?

> **You:** Right, the inverse. Reserved spots ≤ keycards.

This is the skill earning its keep: it didn't silently take the instruction; it
noticed the new rule contradicted an established one and made the human resolve
it. The result is `account-spots-within-keycards`, stated the consistent way.

## Pass 3 — refinement

Last, the agent layers in **attributes** (including the *derived* "state" ones
the conversation surfaced), **enums**, **actions** tied to actors and the
invariants they preserve, and a **glossary** for the human roles — adding only
what earns its place.

> **Agent:** All three passes complete; lints 0/0. Pass 3 added:
>
> - **Glossary**: `Operator`, `Driver`, `Visitor` — human roles, none are
>   entities.
> - **Enums**: `SpotKind` (general/reserved), `AccountStatus` (active/suspended).
> - **The derived "state" attributes you intuited** — `Keycard.inUse` (the
>   anti-passback state), `Spot.occupied`/`Spot.kind`, `Visit.active`,
>   `Ticket.paid`, `Garage.availableSpots`.
> - **Actions** with actors + preserved invariants — notably `Visit`'s four paths
>   (`enter-with-keycard` / `enter-with-ticket` / `exit-monthly` /
>   `exit-temporary`).

The centerpiece is `Visit` — the entity the agent insisted on naming in turn one:

```yaml
Visit:
  definition: >-
    One car's stay in the `Garage`, from entry to exit, occupying a single
    `Spot`. Every `Visit` is started by exactly one credential — a `Keycard`
    (monthly) or a `Ticket` (temporary), never both.
  relationships:
    - entity: Spot
      cardinality: n:1
      ownership: referenced
    - entity: Keycard
      cardinality: n:1
      ownership: referenced
      note: Present when entry was by `Keycard` (monthly).
    - entity: Ticket
      cardinality: 1:1
      ownership: owned
      note: Present when entry was by `Ticket` (temporary).
  invariants:
    - id: visit-one-credential
      statement: >-
        Every `Visit` is started by exactly one credential — a `Keycard` or a
        `Ticket`, never both and never neither.
    - id: visit-exit-after-entry
      statement: A `Visit`'s exit time, once set, is at or after its entry time.
```

Notice `visit-one-credential`: the "exactly one of keycard or ticket" rule the
diagram couldn't express (both edges to `Visit` look optional) lives here as an
invariant. The diagram is the structure; the rules are the text. See
[Reading the Diagrams](../04-reading-the-diagrams.md) for why.

> **Agent:** Two loose ends I left deliberately (flagging, not fixing):
> `Ticket.amountDue` derives from a rate schedule that isn't modeled; and
> `AccountStatus.suspended`'s "keycards refused at the gate" behavior is described
> but not an invariant. Both are honest gaps — say the word if you want them
> tightened.

A model is never "finished." Leaving those visible — rather than inventing a rate
schedule or quietly asserting a rule — is the behavior you want.

## The result

**8 entities, 2 enums, 3 glossary roles, 11 invariants, 7 scenarios** — built in
one conversation, lints completely clean, rendered Markdown committed alongside
the source.

## Advanced: borrowing a concept from another model

:::note[Advanced]

Skip this until you have two models. One model is the normal case, and
everything above works without it.

:::

Late in the session, one more concept turned up — and it did **not** belong to
the garage:

> **You:** The kiosk takes card or cash. Add a payment method to the ticket.
>
> **Agent:** Happy to, but a payment method isn't a parking concept — it's the
> same list your billing system already has, and the moment both models define
> it, they start to drift. Is there another model that owns money?

> **You:** There's a small payments model, yes.

Rather than a second copy of the same list, the garage **references** the one in
the payments model. The payments model needs no changes at all — it doesn't know
it is being referenced:

```yaml
# payments.modelith.yaml — an ordinary model that happens to define the enum
enums:
  PaymentMethod:
    values:
      - name: card
      - name: cash
      - name: account
```

The garage lists the file and writes `scope.Name` at the reference site. The
scope comes from the filename, so `./payments.modelith.yaml` is written
`payments.`:

```yaml
# garage.modelith.yaml
imports:
  - ./payments.modelith.yaml

# ... in Ticket:
      - name: paidWith
        type: payments.PaymentMethod
```

The linter now resolves that reference — a typo like `payments.PaymentMode` is
an error, not a shrug — and the [rendered model](./garage.modelith.md) links
`paidWith` straight to the enum in the
[payments model](./payments.modelith.md). One definition, in the context that
owns it.

The one thing the payments model *may* want to say is that it is on the
receiving end of this. A model whose enums are used only by the models that
import it collects an "enum is defined but no attribute uses it" advisory for
each one, since the uses are in files it cannot see. `shared: true` at the top
level retires that class of advisory — and nothing else. This one declares it,
though its own `Payment` happens to use the enum too.

Full rules, including how to name a scope explicitly when the filename won't do:
[Imports](../06-schema-reference.md#imports).
